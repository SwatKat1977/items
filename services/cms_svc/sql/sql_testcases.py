        Retrieve an overview of test cases organized by folder hierarchy within
        a project.

        This method queries the database using a recursive common table
        expression (CTE) to construct the folder hierarchy for the given
        project. It then retrieves test case IDs associated with each folder.

        Args:
            project_id (int): The ID of the project for which to retrieve test
                              case overviews.

        Returns:
            Optional[dict]: A dictionary containing query results, where
                            folders are mapped to their corresponding test
                            cases. Returns None if the query fails.

        Raises:
            SqliteInterfaceException: If there is a failure while executing the
                                      SQL query.

        Notes:
            - The function uses a recursive CTE (`folder_hierarchy`) to
              determine folder relationships within the project.
            - Test cases are joined with their respective folders.
            - The results are ordered by folder level, folder ID, and test case
              ID.
            - If a fatal SQL error occurs, the database health state is updated
              accordingly.
