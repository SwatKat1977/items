        This method queries the database using a recursive common table

        project. It then retrieves test case IDs associated with each folder.

              determine folder relationships within the project.

            - The results are ordered by folder level, folder ID, and test case
              ID.
            - If a fatal SQL error occurs, the database health state is updated
              accordingly.
